                Welcome to an introduction to cryptocurrencies.  Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin,
                are a form of digital cash that promise to revolutionize the banking and financial
                institutions, while also making giving more control to people holding such currencies.

                        Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a form of electronic cash. It is a decentralized digital
                        currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from
                        user-to-user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.               

                        Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a
                        public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin was invented by an unknown
                        person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and released as open-source
                        software in 2009. Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining.
                        They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. Research produced
                        by the University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million
                        unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.

                <h3>A brief history of Ethereum</h3>

                        Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer
                        involved with Bitcoin Magazine, in late 2013 with a goal of building decentralized
                        applications.  Buterin had argued that Bitcoin needed a scripting language for
                        application development. Failing to gain agreement, he proposed development of a new
                        platform with a more general scripting language.

                        At the time of public announcement in January 2014, the core Ethereum team was Vitalik
                        Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Iorio, and Charles Hoskinson. Formal development of the
                        Ethereum software project began in early 2014 through a Swiss company, Ethereum Switzerland
                        GmbH (EthSuisse). Subsequently, a Swiss non-profit foundation, the Ethereum Foundation
                        (Stiftung Ethereum), was created as well. Development was funded by an online public
                        crowdsale during July - August 2014, with the participants buying the Ethereum value token
                        (ether) with another digital currency, bitcoin.

                        Monero is an open-source cryptocurrency created in April 2014 that focuses on fungibility, privacy
                        and decentralization. Monero uses an obfuscated public ledger, meaning anybody can broadcast
                        or send transactions, but no outside observer can tell the source, amount or destination. 
                        Monero uses a Proof of Work mechanism to issue new coins and incentivize miners to secure
                        the network and validate transactions.

                        The privacy afforded by Monero has attracted illicit use by people interested in evading law
                        enforcement during events such as the WannaCry Ransomware Attack, or on the dark web buying
                        illegal substances.  Despite this, Monero is actively encouraged to those seeking
                        financial privacy, since payments and account balances remain entirely hidden, which is not
                        the standard for most cryptocurrencies.
